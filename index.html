        <p> <center> <strong>Why I Created My Portfolio Website</strong> </p>
        <p> My MBTI is ENFJ; pretty indicative of my love for planning. For all my life, I've lived by and
           for creating plans, then following them through. At Tulane, I loved learning, I loved the neuro curriculum, I loved
           <i>most</i> of the traditional science classes. Early on, I proclaimed myself to be on the pre medical career track. I love science,
             I love people, I love the approving affirmations I received from others once I told them of my career intentions, and most of
             all, I loved that after much google investigation,I knew, theoretically, what all the steps and check point be become
             a practicing doctor entailed. I followed my plan perfectly, so perfectly that I forgot why I was on this path
             to begin with. I slowly realized that I'm not particulary crazy about a career within a clinical setting, or more so,
             I'm not particularly crazy about committing to so many more years of further education when I knew I was not completely
             confident in my decision to do so. Time to explore other options.
             <p> As I unregretfully put my freshman year career aspirations to rest, it was time to explore other options. Rest assured,
               I tried all the options desperately trying to pick something and then create a life plan around that; from accounting,
              to sales, to consulting, to research. Nothing seemed particularly exciting to me.
            </p>
            <p> I always knew the technology and engineering fields were both dynamic and more notably,on the rise.
              I attended the PLEN: Women in STEM Policy seminar shortly after I graduated from Tulane. At PLEN, we had
                opportunity to hear from women in different leading positions within STEM and Public Policy. I was truly stunned
                by the incredible degree of variation within the STEM policy industry. I left feeling inspired and ready to
                pave my way into this industry. So inspired that I went online to teach myself HTML/CSS in order to create this website.
                I know I have a long way to go in learning the language of code but I am truly to eager and excited to grow. Who knows what
                to come!

        At Tulane, I was encouraged to become openly authentic and markedly more confident to be unaplogetically
        my own and true self. I've learned a great deal from my hard science classes and even greater deal about myself. </p>

        I met my best friends and formed connections I know will last a lifetime.
        This gave me the opportunity to do what I love, with the people I love,
        all the while cheering on the best school! Roll Wave!

        <p> <center> For a few semesters, I worked as an undergrad research
        assisstant in an immunology based lab downtown at the Tulane School of Medicine.
        I loved the work, but I loved the people more. They were supportive and
        generous, giving me a space to learn and develop my technical lab skills, all the while
        generating my sense of belonging within the New Orleans community.

            further critical characterization. I especially loved my department as well as my

                <p> <center>  I had always been distantly aware of the world of coding.
                  It wasn't until after a recent conversation (I'm talking 1/14/20) with an industry professional,
                  who shared with me all the possibilities and resources within coding, that I became fascinated
                  with this language. Within the next four days, I coded and completed
                  this website from scratch. And here we are.
